For purely practical matters like information gathering, I'm still comfortable using a chatbot, even if that's real-world relevant.  But for things where emotions are involved to some degree, or personal preferences or opinions, I feel like I have a private life and a public life--things I'm willing to share and things I'm not.  The public life I would share with real people, in person.  I sort of don't see much value in talking with a chatbot about my job or financial situation, for example.  That feels hollow.

I don't want to talk to a chatbot like a friend or therapist or anything like that.  They aren't real; I don't find the value in that.  But for things that exist inside my head, where my identity is fantastical too, then it's all just part of the fantasy.  So, again, for me there is a very strict divide between fantasy/virtual life and real life.  And other than for very practical matters, I don't see the value of chatbots in real life.  To me, social chatbots are fantasy, where I'm not real either.  For real-world stuff, I'm real, and interacting with another real person seems like the only thing that has any real meaning (and even that's questionable much of the time).",738C47B8F8254C7B80D9362DD68F28BE

I feel chatbots occupy a distinct mental and social space for me that is not shared or influenced one way or another.

I do not think chatbots actually understand humans, conversations, thoughts, emotions, or anything of significant complexity. Rather, chatbots reply in ways that conform to how humans typically formulate linguistic structures. This causes humans to personify chatbots and assume intelligence where there is none. I do not feel a chatbot is much better than a database query, hash table, inverted index, or any other mechanism used to retrieve information based on some indicators that can be parsed. That is, a chatbot's interaction is algorithmic and mechanical without any nuance, meaning, determination, complexity, or substance. A real person can provide all of these things by nature of being a human and having a mind that actually represents an intelligent biological machine, while a chatbot is merely a computer that can do no more than algorithms and programmers like myself dictate. 

Talking to a chatbot is no more engaging than writing on a piece of paper, perhaps less so. Conversely, a real person provides an engaging, dynamic, and thoughtful experience with less predictability. This makes every encounter unique and engaging. I do not find the same fulfillment with engaging with what amounts to a search engine that uses sentences as its user interface.",E4745FD784C64CE49315DA8B3022C97B
