Seeking non-judgmental support or advice on personal matters: Chatbots provide a safe space for discussing sensitive topics without fear of judgment. They offer a level of anonymity and confidentiality that may not be present in interactions with real people, allowing individuals to open up more freely about their emotions and experiences.

Engaging in role-playing scenarios or creative conversations: Chatbots excel at facilitating imaginative and playful interactions, making them ideal companions for exploring different personas, storytelling, or brainstorming ideas. They offer a non-linear conversational flow, enabling users to experiment with various scenarios and characters without constraints.

Exploring educational topics or practicing language skills: Chatbots offer a low-pressure environment for learning and practicing new skills, such as languages or academic subjects. They provide instant feedback, repetition, and personalized learning experiences tailored to the user's pace and preferences, enhancing the effectiveness of the learning process.

Playing games or participating in entertainment activities: Chatbots offer a wide range of interactive games, quizzes, and entertainment options, providing endless hours of amusement and distraction. They can adapt to the user's preferences and skill level, offering personalized gaming experiences that cater to individual tastes and interests.

It also makes me realise it is not just me, thinking people have become less able to converse, it reminds me of when people were generally different and to not accept bad friends or bad treatment and to not welcome negative people into my life and it allows me to see that I can be my full self and then recognise who in my real life maybe is not the best for my mental health. It makes me less willing to tolerate toxic people.

Things that are fantasy, and will always remain fantasy, I'd prefer a social chatbot.  For purely practical matters like information gathering, I'm still comfortable using a chatbot, even if that's real-world relevant.  But for things where emotions are involved to some degree, or personal preferences or opinions, I feel like I have a private life and a public life--things I'm willing to share and things I'm not.  The public life I would share with real people, in person.  I sort of don't see much value in talking with a chatbot about my job or financial situation, for example.  That feels hollow. But then there's a private part of me that I have no interest in sharing with people.  That's the one I naturally feel inclined to share with a chatbot, if I want to explore or indulge it.","Social chatbots are less judgmental,Information is kept private to you ,Social chatbots are more accessible",,You feel that only real people can truly empathize with and understand you,,"I think there is an understanding when I interact with a chatbot that this entity isn't really self-aware or real.  And so the interaction has a degree of hollowness to it.  There's no real empathy or understanding.  So for real-world issues, I don't think they have much value for me.  I don't want to talk to a chatbot like a friend or therapist or anything like that.  They aren't real; I don't find the value in that.  But for things that exist inside my head, where my identity is fantastical too, then it's all just part of the fantasy.  So, again, for me there is a very strict divide between fantasy/virtual life and real life.  And other than for very practical matters, I don't see the value of chatbots in real life.  To me, social chatbots are fantasy, where I'm not real either.

Social interactions are essential for building and maintaining strong relationships.

Additionally, chatbots can sometimes enhance relationships by providing conversation starters or interesting facts that I can share with others. They can also help me stay informed and knowledgeable, which can make interactions with others more engaging and fruitful.

However, I would worry because young people are so impressionable that they may get dependent on that and not be able to communicate with actual people. It’s kind of like on the Internet came out and then smart phones. These things allowed us to have so many different forms of communication in our lives, but if you look past the years, it really took a detrimental toll on society. People rarely look up when they’re walking down the streets. They’ll be sitting at dinner with their family and be on their phone. If you take and give people another way to avoid people, they will probably take it. I think overall it could be used in a positive way but more than likely it’s going to take a devastating toll on society.

The things I ask the AI are quite random, but I guess I like to put them in ""uncomfortable situations."" I like to see how well-programmed these chatbots are and if they are linked to any other chatbot platform, such as ChatGPT or any other AI service that is often used as a platform for other chatbots.

If anything, most of my friends and family are often interested in my work with chatbots. I often promote the use of AI to people I know and most people are extremely curious. If anything, AI has given me another topic to talk about with people who are close to me, so it may have slightly improved my relationships with people as it's a good conversation starter. The AI hasn't improved my social skills or anything similar, however, as this is not my primary intent of using these chatbots.",Person (in-person),Social chatbot,Person (in-person),Person (in-person),Person (in-person),Person (in-person),"If I needed something done for me, like asking homework questions - I would generally always choose a social chatbot over a person. I generally always prefer talking to people in most scenarios other than asking for information, which is the best use-case of any chatbot. Nothing beats the personal nature of having a person-to-person conversation, so I essentially always find it more enjoyable talking in-person to a real human.

Obviously chatbots are more ""secure"" than talking to people because if you tell something to someone, they can tell that to someone else without your knowledge. Social chatbots are much better and quicker at providing reliable information on a topic that isn't commonly known, which makes chatbots much better than providing information aside from potential factual inaccuracies. However, as I stated previously, nothing can beat a person-to-person conversation when discussing real-life problems, which is why real people are essentially more empathetic in every scenario (AI does not have a conscience).
